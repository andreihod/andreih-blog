Hey, I’m Andrei!

I’m a software engineer from Brazil who loves coding and open source. Lately, I’ve been focused on Android, Jetpack Compose, and Rust.

Right now, I’m working at [Bipa](https://bipa.app/), a Brazilian fintech, building cool stuff in the financial space.

Always up for learning, coding, and geeking out over tech.
